Create table:
CREATE TABLE my_table_name (column_name column_type constraints);
	example:
	CREATE TABLE student (name Varchar(25) NOT NULL, grade INTEGER)

Read table:
SELECT * FROM my_table_name;
	example:
	SELECT * FROM student;

Update table:
	** changing the table, like VARCHAR(25) to VARCHAR(45) would look something like:
		ALTER TABLE student
		MODIFY name VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL;

	**changing the actual value in a table:
		UPDATE student SET grade = 100 WHERE name = "derponica";
Deleting from table:
DELETE FROM my_table_name WHERE requirements/specifications;
	example:
	DELETE FROM student where grade = 100;
