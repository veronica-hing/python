# Four Pillars of OOP

## 1. Encapsulation
    - takes similar code and groups them together

## 2. Inheritance
- allows us to re-use classes to build other classes that are similar but may have some differences

- allows us to call `super()` to access parent methods

- `super().__init__()` calls the parent constructor and returns an instance of the parent

## 3. Polymorphism
- the child can have the same methods as the parent that are different.
